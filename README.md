## How to Run

### üì• Download Pre-built Executables (Recommended)

**Latest Stable Release:**
1. Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/colinmxs/noita-savescummer/releases/latest)
2. Download the appropriate file for your system:
   - **Windows**: `noita-savescummer-windows-x64.zip`
   - **macOS (Intel)**: `noita-savescummer-macos-x64.tar.gz`
   - **macOS (Apple Silicon)**: `noita-savescummer-macos-arm64.tar.gz`
   - **Linux**: `noita-savescummer-linux-x64.tar.gz`
3. Extract the archive
4. Run the executable (see instructions below)

**Development Builds (Latest Features):**
- Check the [dev-latest release](https://github.com/colinmxs/noita-savescummer/releases/tag/dev-latest) for cutting-edge builds

### üöÄ Running the Application

**Windows:**
```bash
# Extract and run
noita-savescummer.exe
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Windows Security Notice:**
If Windows Defender SmartScreen blocks the app with "Microsoft Defender SmartScreen prevented an unrecognized app from starting":

1. **Click "More info"** in the SmartScreen dialog
2. **Click "Run anyway"** at the bottom
3. **Alternative**: Right-click the exe ‚Üí Properties ‚Üí General tab ‚Üí Check "Unblock" ‚Üí Apply ‚Üí OK

This happens because the executable isn't code-signed yet. The application is safe - you can verify by checking the source code in this repository.

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
# Extract, make executable, and run
chmod +x noita-savescummer
./noita-savescummer
```

## Building from Source

If you prefer to build from source or contribute to development:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/colinmxs/noita-savescummer.git
cd noita-savescummer
dotnet build --configuration Release
dotnet run
```

### Development
- Built with .NET 9.0
- Clean architecture with separated concerns
- Comprehensive error handling
- Async/await for responsive operations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Microsoft Defender SmartScreen prevented an unrecognized app from starting"**
- Click "More info" then "Run anyway" in the SmartScreen dialog
- Alternative: Right-click executable ‚Üí Properties ‚Üí Check "Unblock" ‚Üí Apply
- This occurs because the executable isn't code-signed (working on fixing this)
- The application is completely safe - source code is available for verification

**"Noita save directory not found"**
- Ensure Noita has been run at least once to create the save directory
- Check that Noita is installed in the standard Steam/GOG location

**"Permission denied"**
- Run as administrator if backup location is restricted
- Ensure backup directory is writable

**"Application already running"**
- Only one instance can run at a time
- Check system tray or task manager for existing process
